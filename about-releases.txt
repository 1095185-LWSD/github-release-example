GitHub Releases Demo

This repo shows how GitHub Releases work.

- A release is a snapshot of the repo at a tag.
- Each release can include notes (written in Markdown).
- GitHub automatically generates a .zip of the source.
- Optional: you can attach binaries (like an .exe) so others donâ€™t need to build it.

Uses for releases in class: checkpoints and easy snapshot downloads.
